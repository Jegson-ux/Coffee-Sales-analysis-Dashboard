**[Recommendation]()**

Based on the analysis I recommend the following;

- Consider focusing on top-selling products such as Espresso Capsules and Barista Espresso. Increasing their stock and promoting these items more aggressively can help boost sales further.
- The Hell's Kitchen location is experiencing high sales but lower quantities sold. It may be beneficial to explore strategies to boost foot traffic or increase the average transaction size at this particular location
- The “Sales and Quantity per Product Category” identify categories that sell well in quantity but not in sales value. This could indicate a need to review and possibly adjust your pricing strategies for those categories.
- Consider implementing new marketing strategies for Gourmet Brewed Coffee, such as special promotions or discounts, to attract more customers and benefit to the products and consider targeted local advertising to raise awareness.
- I recommend the Collection and analyze customer feedback to understand preferences and areas for improvement. This can help tailor the product offerings and services to better meet customer needs.
- Reviewing the customer feedback to identify potential issues and address them.

**[Conclusion]()**

- Barista Espresso is the top-selling product among the top 15 product types.
- Store A has achieved the highest sales revenue and sold the greatest quantity of items compared to all other stores.
- Beverages make up the majority of sales revenue and are the most commonly sold items.
